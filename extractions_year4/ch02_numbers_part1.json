Even numbers end with $2, 4, 6, 8$ or $0$. All even numbers are divisible by $2$. Numbers that are not even are odd.\n\n2. Ascending order means increasing order.\n   Descending order means decreasing order.\n\n3. These statements do not have the same meaning:\n   (a) A and B have $20$ marbles.

In questions involving \"more than\" or \"less than\", fill in your answer and read the statement again to make sure it is correct.\n\n5. Drawing models is not compulsory unless instructed to. However, it is important to learn the technique, as it will be useful in solving challenging problems. Hence, teachers generally recommend drawing models for all long answer word problems (or problem sums).",
