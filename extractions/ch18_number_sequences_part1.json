We can therefore use an arithmetic sequence to model the number of items exactly.\n\nMost real-world scenarios will not be this exact. Instead, random variation may give us a sequence where the difference between terms is similar, but not the same. In these cases we can use an arithmetic sequence as an approximation.\n\nFor example, the table below shows the total mass of people in a lift as they walk in:\n\n| $n$ (people) | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n| Mass (kg) | 86.2 | 147.5 | 210.1 | 298.4 | 385.0 | 459.8 |\n\nNo two people will have exactly the same mass, so the total mass of people will not form an exact arithmetic sequence. However, since the average mass of the people is $\\frac{459.8}{6} \\approx 76.6$ kg, a reasonable model for the total mass would be the arithmetic sequence $u_n = 76.6n$.",
