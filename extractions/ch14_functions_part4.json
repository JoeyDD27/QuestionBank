Find $g(7)$.\n\nSolution for Problem 16.12: What is wrong with this solution:\n\nBogus Solution: $g(7) = 2(7)^3 - 3(7) + 5 = 2(343) - 21 + 5 = 670$.\n\nThis solution assumes that $g(x) = 2x^3 - 3x + 5$; however, this is not necessarily true! We only know that when $f(x)$ is put into $g(x)$, the result is $2x^3 - 3x + 5$. While we can let $x = 7$ in $g(f(x)) = 2x^3 - 3x + 5$ to say\n\n$g(f(7)) = 2(7)^3 - 3(7) + 5 = 2(343) - 21 + 5 = 670$,\n\nwe can't simply put $x = 7$ in $2x^3 - 3x + 5$ to evaluate $g(7)$. We can only use the substitution $x = 7$ to evaluate $g(f(7))$.\n\nSince we know what comes out when we put $f(x)$ into $g(x)$, and we want to know what happens when we put 7 into $g(x)$, we need to figure out when $f(x) = 7$. This will tell us what $x$ to use in $g(f(x))$ to figure out $g(7)$. From $f(x) = 7$, we have\n\n$3 - 2x = 7$,\n\nfrom which we find $x = -2$. Now we can use our expression for $g(f(x))$:\n\n$g(7) = g(f(-2)) = 2(-2)^3 - 3(-2) + 5 = -16 + 6 + 5 = -5$.",

We don't know much about $g$, so this equation is hard to work with - we don't know what to substitute $f(x)$ into, for example.

Since $f$ is the inverse of $g$, the function $g$ must also be the inverse of $f$, so\n\n$g(f(x)) = x$.\n\nSubstituting $f(x)$ into $g(x)$, we have\n\n$\\frac{2f(x) - 3}{f(x) + 5} = x$.\n\nWe can let $f(x) = y$ to prevent confusion:\n\n$\\frac{2y - 3}{y + 5} = x$.\n\nWe wish to isolate $y$. We start by getting rid of the fraction by multiplying both sides by $y + 5$:\n\n$2y - 3 = x(y + 5)$.\n\nExpanding the right side, then moving all the terms with $y$ in them to the left and terms without $y$ to the right gives\n\n$2y - xy = 5x + 3$.\n\nFactoring $y$ out of the left side gives $y(2 - x) = 5x + 3$, and dividing by $2 - x$ gives\n\n$f(x) = y = \\frac{5x + 3}{2 - x}$.\n\nTherefore, we have\n\n$f(4) = \\frac{5(4) + 3}{2 - 4} = -\\frac{23}{2}$.\n\nSolution 2: Use the meaning of inverse function. Since $f$ is the inverse of $g$, we know that\n\n$f(g(x)) = x$\n\nfor all $x$, so $f(g(k)) = k$. If $g(k) = 4$, then we have $f(g(k)) = f(4)$. Putting this together with $f(g(k)) = k$ gives $f(4) = f(g(k)) = k$. Therefore, we can solve $g(k) = 4$ for $k$ to find $f(4)$:\n\n$g(k) = \\frac{2k - 3}{k + 5} = 4$.\n\nMultiplying both sides by $k + 5$ gives $2k - 3 = 4(k + 5)$.

One way to find $f(5)$ is to find the $x$ that allows us to input 5 into $f$ using the definition of $f(x - 3)$. Solving $x - 3 = 5$ gives $x = 8$.

(Source: HMMT)\n\nConcept: Start experimenting with functional equations by trying simple values like 0 and 1.\n\nWe choose simple values of $a$, $b$, and $n$ that satisfy\n\n$a + b = 2^n$.\n\nThe simplest is $a = 1$, $b = 1$, and $n = 1$. Since $1 + 1 = 2^1$, we are told that\n\n$f(1) + f(1) = 1^2$.\n\nTherefore, $f(1) = 1^2/2 = 1/2$. We found one value of $f(m)$! But we're still pretty far from finding $f(2002)$. However, this simple example suggests a way to find some more values for $f(m)$. Since $2 + 2 = 2^2$, we have\n\n$f(2) + f(2) = 2^2 = 4$.\n\nSo, $f(2) = 2^2/2 = 2$. Similarly, $4 + 4 = 2^3$, so\n\n$f(4) + f(4) = 3^2 = 9$,\n\nand $f(4) = 3^2/2 = 9/2$. In this same way, we find $f(8) = 4^2/2 = 8$, $f(16) = 5^2/2 = 25/2$, and so on. We can prove that this pattern always works. For each power of 2, we have\n\n$2^k + 2^k = 2 \\cdot 2^k = 2^{k+1}$.\n\nTherefore.\n\n$f(2^k) + f(2^k) = (k + 1)^2$,\n\nso $f(2^k) = (k + 1)^2/2$.\n\nBut how do we find $f(m)$ if $m$ is not a power of 2? Let's try experimenting again by trying to find $f(3)$. We must have $a + 3 = 2^n$ in order to be able to use $f(a) + f(3) = n^2$ to find $f(3)$. Furthermore, we must know $f(a)$, since we can't let $a = 3$. Fortunately, $a = 1$ fits the bill: $1 + 3 = 2^2$, so\n\n$f(1) + f(3) = 2^2 = 4$.\n\nWe already have $f(1) = 1/2$, so $f(3) = 4 - f(1) = 7/2$.\n\nBut how does this help with $f(2002)$? It gives us some guidance: we see that we need a number $a$ such that $a + 2002 = 2^n$. The smallest such number is 46:\n\n$46 + 2002 = 2^{11}$.\n\nSo, we know that $f(46) + f(2002) = 11^2 = 121$, from which we have\n\n$f(2002) = 121 - f(46)$.\n\nUnfortunately, we don't know $f(46)$. However, if we find $f(46)$, then we can find $f(2002)$, so we've reduced our problem from finding $f(2002)$ to finding $f(46)$. This appears to be a simpler problem.\n\nWe investigate $f(46)$ just as we investigated $f(2002)$. Since $46 + 18 = 2^6$, we have $f(46) + f(18) = 6^2 = 36$, so\n\n$f(46) = 36 - f(18)$,\n\nand we've reduced our problem to finding $f(18)$. This is promising, so we continue.\n\nSince $18 + 14 = 2^5$, we have $f(18) + f(14) = 25$, so $f(18) = 25 - f(14)$.\n\nSince $14 + 2 = 2^4$, we have $f(14) + f(2) = 4^2 = 16$, so $f(14) = 16 - f(2)$. But we already know $f(2) = 2$! We have $f(14) = 16 - 2 = 14$. Now we can work back through our equations above to find $f(2002)$.\n\nWe have $f(18) = 25 - f(14) = 11$, so $f(46) = 36 - f(18) = 25$, so $f(2002) = 121 - f(46) = 96$.\n\nThis problem highlighted two of the most important problem solving strategies: experimentation and working backwards. Try them on the following problems whenever you get stuck.",
