Rather than deal with those huge numbers, let's replace them with smaller numbers. Our huge numbers are 2 apart, so we replace them with smaller numbers that are 2 apart:\n\n$3^2 - 2(3)(1) + 1^2 = 4$,\n$4^2 - 2(4)(2) + 2^2 = 4$,\n$5^2 - 2(5)(3) + 3^2 = 4$,\n$6^2 - 2(6)(4) + 4^2 = 4$.\n\nLooks like a pretty clear pattern! But how do we know it will continue all the way up to 20062005?\n\nReplace the big numbers with variable expressions. Rather than deal with the big numbers, we set one of them equal to $x$. If we let $x = 20062003$, then $20062005 = x + 2$, so we can write our expression as:\n\n$(x + 2)^2 - 2(x + 2)(x) + x^2$.\n\nNow we multiply everything out, hoping we can at least get rid of the $x^2$ terms so we don't have to square any big numbers:\n\n$(x + 2)^2 - 2(x + 2)(x) + x^2 = (x^2 + 4x + 4) - (2x^2 + 4x) + x^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4 - 2x^2 - 4x + x^2 = 4$.\n\nNot only did the $x^2$ terms cancel, but so did the $x$ terms! We now see that the pattern we found earlier does indeed hold for all numbers that differ by two.\n\nRecognize the expanded square. We could have saved ourselves a lot of work by recognizing that our original expression is the square of a binomial:\n\n$20062005^2 - 2(20062005)(20062003) + (20062003)^2 = (20062005 - 20062003)^2 = 2^2 = 4$.",

So we write 71 as $70 + 1$:\n\n$71^2 = (70 + 1)^2 = 70^2 + 2(70)(1) + 1^2 = 4900 + 140 + 1 = 5041$.\n\n(b) That worked so well, let's try it again:\n\n$65^2 = (60 + 5)^2 = 60^2 + 2(60)(5) + 5^2 = 3600 + 600 + 25 = 4225$.\n\nThis one's easy to do because the middle term, $2(60)(5)$, is so easy to compute, since $(2)(5) = 10$.\n\n(c) 200 isn't too hard to square, so we let $204 = 200 + 4$:\n\n$204^2 = (200 + 4)^2 = 200^2 + 2(200)(4) + 4^2 = 40000 + 1600 + 16 = 41616$.\n\n(d) 99 is just 1 away from 100:\n\n$99^2 = (100 - 1)^2 = 100^2 - 2(100)(1) + 1 = 10000 - 200 + 1 = 9801$.",

After the 1 at the top, we generate each number in the triangle by adding the two numbers directly above it. For example, the bold 15 is the sum of the 10 and the 5 just above it. (We pretend the 1's on the sides are below a 0 and a 1.)\n\nOf course, the triangle doesn't stop after 7 rows!

We like this because we can factor the left side:\n\n$(m - n)(m + n) = 105$.\n\nBecause $m$ and $n$ are integers, so are $m - n$ and $m + n$. Therefore, both $m - n$ and $m + n$ are factors of 105. We can use the different possible factorizations of 105 to give us the different possible values of $m - n$ and $m + n$:\n\n$(m - n)(m + n) = 1 \\cdot 105 = 3 \\cdot 35 = 5 \\cdot 21 = 7 \\cdot 15$.\n\nBecause $m$ and $n$ are positive, we know that $m - n$ is smaller than $m + n$, so we only have these four cases to consider:\n\n$m - n = 1$ and $m + n = 105$\n$m - n = 3$ and $m + n = 35$\n$m - n = 5$ and $m + n = 21$\n$m - n = 7$ and $m + n = 15$\n\nEach of these systems of equations gives us a solution $(m, n)$. Adding the equations in the first case gives us $2m = 106$, so $m = 53$. Substitution then gives $n = 52$. Similarly, we can work through each of the other three cases to find the four solutions $(m, n) = (53, 52); (19, 16); (13, 8); (11, 4)$.",

Solving that second equation for $z$ looks pretty scary, though. Moreover, if $z$ is itself a nasty expression, it may not be so easy to evaluate $x$.\n\nWhat makes this problem tricky are the square roots.\n\nConcept: Focusing on what makes a problem tricky helps identify what strategies might best solve the problem.\n\nWe know that squaring gets rid of square roots, but squaring either of our equations doesn't look too helpful. However, we notice that the right sides of our equations are of the form $a - b$ and $a + b$, where $a = z$ and $b = \\sqrt{z^2 - 5}$. We could add them to get rid of $\\sqrt{z^2 - 5}$, but that would give $x + 5y = 2z$, and we're back to having to find $z$.\n\nInstead of getting rid of $b$, we reach back to our squaring idea to get rid of the square roots. Because $(a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2$, multiplying the two equations will get rid of the square roots:\n\n$(x)(5y) = \\left(z - \\sqrt{z^2 - 5}\\right)\\left(z + \\sqrt{z^2 - 5}\\right)$.\n\nThe right side is the factorization of a difference of squares, so we have\n\n$5xy = (z)^2 - \\left(\\sqrt{z^2 - 5}\\right)^2 = z^2 - (z^2 - 5) = 5$.\n\nTherefore, $xy = 1$.

(Source: Mandelbrot)\n\nSolution for Problem 11.13: We can start by computing a few simpler expressions that follow the same pattern as the expression we must evaluate:\n\n$\\sqrt{7 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 1 + 16} = \\sqrt{121} = 11$,\n$\\sqrt{8 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2 + 16} = \\sqrt{400} = 20$,\n$\\sqrt{9 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3 + 16} = \\sqrt{961} = 31$,\n$\\sqrt{10 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 4 + 16} = \\sqrt{1936} = 44$.\n\nWe have a hint of a pattern. The difference between the second and first results is $20 - 11 = 9$. The difference between the third and second results is $31 - 20 = 11$, and between the fourth and third is $44 - 31 = 13$. We might be able to guess that the next term is $44 + 15 = 59$, then the next is $59 + 17 = 76$, and so on. But how do we know our pattern will always hold?\n\nAs we've done before when facing large numbers, we use a variable to represent one of the numbers in the hopes of then simplifying the resulting expression. If we let $x = 1992$, our expression is\n\n$\\sqrt{(x + 6)(x + 4)(x + 2)x + 16}$.\n\nMultiplying that out looks like a bit of a headache. Before we do so, we consider whether we might make a different variable substitution that will allow us to use one of our special factorizations. We know products like $(z - a)(z + a)$ are easy to handle, so if we let $z = 1995$, which is right in the middle of our four big numbers, we'll have something that's easier to expand:\n\n$\\sqrt{(z + 3)(z + 1)(z - 1)(z - 3) + 16} = \\sqrt{(z + 3)(z - 3)(z + 1)(z - 1) + 16}$\n$= \\sqrt{(z^2 - 9)(z^2 - 1) + 16}$\n$= \\sqrt{z^4 - 10z^2 + 9 + 16}$\n$= \\sqrt{z^4 - 10z^2 + 25}$\n\nWe recognize $z^4 - 10z^2 + 25$ as the square of $z^2 - 5$, so\n\n$\\sqrt{(z + 3)(z + 1)(z - 1)(z - 3) + 16} = \\sqrt{z^4 - 10z^2 + 25} = z^2 - 5$.\n\nFor $z = 1995$, we have\n\n$1995^2 - 5 = (2000 - 5)^2 - 5 = 2000^2 - 2(2000)(5) + 5^2 - 5 = 4000000 - 20000 + 25 - 5 = 3,980,020$.\n\nNotice our varied use of our knowledge of special factorizations throughout this problem.",
