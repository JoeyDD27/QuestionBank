We like this because we can factor the left side:\n\n$(m - n)(m + n) = 105$.\n\nBecause $m$ and $n$ are integers, so are $m - n$ and $m + n$. Therefore, both $m - n$ and $m + n$ are factors of 105. We can use the different possible factorizations of 105 to give us the different possible values of $m - n$ and $m + n$:\n\n$(m - n)(m + n) = 1 \\cdot 105 = 3 \\cdot 35 = 5 \\cdot 21 = 7 \\cdot 15$.\n\nBecause $m$ and $n$ are positive, we know that $m - n$ is smaller than $m + n$, so we only have these four cases to consider:\n\n$m - n = 1$, $m + n = 105$\n$m - n = 3$, $m + n = 35$\n$m - n = 5$, $m + n = 21$\n$m - n = 7$, $m + n = 15$",

      "content_latex": "Solution for Problem 11.12: One approach would be to substitute $y = \\frac{2}{3}$ in the second equation, solve for $z$, then substitute that solution into the first equation. Solving that second equation for $z$ looks pretty scary, though. Moreover, if $z$ is itself a nasty expression, it may not be so easy to evaluate $x$.\n\nWhat makes this problem tricky are the square roots.\n\nConcept: Focusing on what makes a problem tricky helps identify what strategies might best solve the problem.\n\nWe know that squaring gets rid of square roots, but squaring either of our equations doesn't look too helpful. However, we notice that the right sides of our equations are of the form $a - b$ and $a + b$, where $a = z$ and $b = \\sqrt{z^2 - 5}$. We could add them to get rid of $\\sqrt{z^2 - 5}$, but that would give $x + 5y = 2z$, and we're back to having to find $z$.\n\nInstead of getting rid of $b$, we reach back to our squaring idea to get rid of the square roots. Because $(a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2$, multiplying the two equations will get rid of the square roots:\n\n$(x)(5y) = \\left(z - \\sqrt{z^2 - 5}\\right)\\left(z + \\sqrt{z^2 + 5}\\right)$.\n\nThe right side is the factorization of a difference of squares, so we have\n\n$5xy = (z)^2 - \\left(\\sqrt{z^2 - 5}\\right)^2 = z^2 - (z^2 - 5) = 5$.\n\nTherefore, $xy = 1$. Since $y = \\frac{2}{3}$, we conclude that $x = \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{3}{2}$. $\\square$",

The difference between the second and first results is $20 - 11 = 9$. The difference between the third and second results is $31 - 20 = 11$, and between the fourth and third is $44 - 31 = 13$. We might be able to guess that the next term is $44 + 15 = 59$, then the next is $59 + 17 = 76$, and so on.

Typically, the quadratic factor is the easier one to spot in the sum and difference of cubes factorizations. Here, the $x^2 - xy + y^2$ and $x^2 + xy + y^2$ are giveaways.
