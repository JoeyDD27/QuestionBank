If x/3 = 3z, then x = 9z. Substituting x = 9z into f(x/3) = x^2 + x + 1 gives f(9z/3) = (9z)^2 + 9z + 1, so f(3z) = 81z^2 + 9z + 1. Therefore, the equation f(3z) = 7 becomes 81z^2 + 9z + 1 = 7, so 81z^2 + 9z - 6 = 0. The sum of the roots of this quadratic is -(9/81) = -1/9.",

        "text": "We choose simple values of a, b, and n that satisfy a + b = 2^n.\n\nThe simplest is a = 1, b = 1, and n = 1. Since 1 + 1 = 2^1, we are told that f(1) + f(1) = 1^2.\n\nTherefore, f(1) = 1^2/2 = 1/2. We found one value of f(m)! But we're still pretty far from finding f(2002). However, this simple example suggests a way to find some more values for f(m). Since 2 + 2 = 2^2, we have f(2) + f(2) = 2^2 = 4.\n\nSo, f(2) = 2^2/2 = 2. Similarly, 4 + 4 = 2^3, so f(4) + f(4) = 3^2 = 9, and f(4) = 3^2/2 = 9/2. In this same way, we find f(8) = 4^2/2 = 8, f(16) = 5^2/2 = 25/2, and so on. We can prove that this pattern always works. For each power of 2, we have 2^k + 2^k = 2 * 2^k = 2^(k+1).\n\nTherefore, f(2^k) + f(2^k) = (k + 1)^2, so f(2^k) = (k + 1)^2/2.\n\nBut how do we find f(m) if m is not a power of 2? Let's try experimenting again by trying to find f(3). We must have a + 3 = 2^n in order to be able to use f(a) + f(3) = n^2 to find f(3). Furthermore, we must know f(a), since we can't let a = 3. Fortunately, a = 1 fits the bill: 1 + 3 = 2^2, so f(1) + f(3) = 2^2 = 4.\n\nWe already have f(1) = 1/2, so f(3) = 4 - f(1) = 7/2.\n\nBut how does this help with f(2002)? It gives us some guidance: we see that we need a number a such that a + 2002 = 2^n. The smallest such number is 46:\n\n46 + 2002 = 2^11.\n\nSo, we know that f(46) + f(2002) = 11^2 = 121, from which we have f(2002) = 121 - f(46).\n\nUnfortunately, we don't know f(46). However, if we find f(46), then we can find f(2002), so we've reduced our problem from finding f(2002) to finding f(46). This appears to be a simpler problem.\n\nWe investigate f(46) just as we investigated f(2002). Since 46 + 18 = 2^6, we have f(46) + f(18) = 6^2 = 36, so f(46) = 36 - f(18), and we've reduced our problem to finding f(18).\n\nSince 18 + 14 = 2^5, we have f(18) + f(14) = 25, so f(18) = 25 - f(14).\n\nSince 14 + 2 = 2^4, we have f(14) + f(2) = 4^2 = 16, so f(14) = 16 - f(2). But we already know f(2) = 2! We have f(14) = 16 - 2 = 14. Now we can work back through our equations above to find f(2002).\n\nWe have f(18) = 25 - f(14) = 11, so f(46) = 36 - f(18) = 25, so f(2002) = 121 - f(46) = 96.\n\nThis problem highlighted two of the most important problem solving strategies: experimentation and working backwards.
