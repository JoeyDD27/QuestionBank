The account pays an interest rate of $4\\%$ per annum (p.a.). The interest is added to your investment each year, so at the end of each year you will have $100\\% + 4\\% = 104\\%$ of the value at its start. This corresponds to a multiplier of $1.04$.\n\nAfter one year your investment is worth $\\$1000 \\times 1.04 = \\$1040$.\n\nAfter two years it is worth\n$\\$1040 \\times 1.04$\n$= \\$1000 \\times 1.04 \\times 1.04$\n$= \\$1000 \\times (1.04)^2$\n$= \\$1081.60$\n\nAfter three years it is worth\n$\\$1081.60 \\times 1.04$\n$= \\$1000 \\times (1.04)^2 \\times 1.04$\n$= \\$1000 \\times (1.04)^3$\n$\\approx \\$1124.86$\n\nObserve that: $u_0 = \\$1000$ = initial investment\n$u_1 = u_0 \\times 1.04$ = amount after 1 year\n$u_2 = u_0 \\times (1.04)^2$ = amount after 2 years\n$u_3 = u_0 \\times (1.04)^3$ = amount after 3 years\n$\\vdots$\n$u_n = u_0 \\times (1.04)^n$ = amount after $n$ years\n\nSo the amount in the account after each year forms a geometric sequence!",

Most interest payments are made at the end of the time periods.\n\nWhen calculating compound interest using electronic technology, notice that:\n\n- The initial investment is entered as a negative value, because that money is moving from you to the bank. The future value is the money you receive at the end of the investment, so $FV$ is positive.\n- $N$ represents the number of compounding periods, not the number of years.\n- $I$ is always the percentage interest rate per annum.",
