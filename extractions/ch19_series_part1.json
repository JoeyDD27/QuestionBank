Show that there are two possible series, and find the first term and the common ratio in each case.\n\n8. An infinite geometric series has $S = \\frac{64}{3}$ and $S_3 = 21$. Find $S_5$.\n\n9. When dropped, a ball takes 1 second to hit the ground. It then takes 90% of this time to rebound to its new height, and this continues until the ball comes to rest.\n\n(a) Show that the total time of motion is given by $1 + 2(0.9) + 2(0.9)^2 + 2(0.9)^3 + ....$\n\n(b) Find $S_n$ for the series in a.\n\n(c) How long does it take for the ball to come to rest?\n\n10. When a ball is dropped, it rebounds 75% of its height after each bounce. If the ball travels a total distance of 490 cm, from what height was the ball dropped?\n\n11. (a) Explain why $0.\\overline{9} = 1$ exactly.\n\n(b) Show that if $u_n = \\frac{9}{10^n}$, then $S_n = 1 - \\frac{1}{10^n}$.\n\n(c) On a graph, plot the points $(n, u_n)$ and $(n, S_n)$ for $n = 1, 2, ...., 10$. Connect each set of points with a smooth curve.\n\n12. Find $x$ if $\\displaystyle\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{3x}{2}\\right)^{k-1} = 4$.\n\n13. Suppose $u_1 + u_2 + u_3 + u_4 + ....$ is a convergent infinite geometric series, with $u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4, .... > 0$.\n\n(a) Explain why $u_1 - u_2 + u_3 - u_4 + ....$ and $\\sqrt{u_1} + \\sqrt{u_2} + \\sqrt{u_3} + \\sqrt{u_4} + ....$ must also be convergent infinite geometric series.\n\n(b) Given $u_1 - u_2 + u_3 - u_4 + .... = \\frac{81}{10}$ and $\\sqrt{u_1} + \\sqrt{u_2} + \\sqrt{u_3} + \\sqrt{u_4} + .... = \\frac{9}{2}$, find $u_1 + u_2 + u_3 + u_4 + ....$\n\n14.
