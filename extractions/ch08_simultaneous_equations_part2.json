A variable is easy to eliminate from two linear equations when its coefficients in the two equations are opposites (adding the equations eliminates the variable), or when these coefficients are the same (subtracting the equations eliminates the variable). Using this as a guide, we focus on eliminating $y$, because multiplying the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3 makes each coefficient of $y$ equal to either 6 or $-6$:\n\n$4x - 6y + 12z = -24$,\n\n$15x + 6y - 24z = 87$,\n\n$7x + 6y + 4z = 49$.\n\nWe can add the first two equations to eliminate $y$:\n\n$4x - 6y + 12z = -24$\n\n$15x + 6y - 24z = 87$\n\n$19x - 12z = 63$\n\nAdding the first and third equations also eliminates $y$ and leaves a two-variable linear equation:\n\n$4x - 6y + 12z = -24$\n\n$7x + 6y + 4z = 49$\n\n$11x + 16z = 25$\n\nThese two equations together are a system of two variable linear equations:\n\n$19x - 12z = 63$,\n\n$11x + 16z = 25$.\n\nMultiplying the first equation by 4 and the second by 3 allows us to eliminate $z$ by adding the resulting equations:\n\n$76x - 48z = 252$\n\n$33x + 48z = 75$\n\n$109x = 327$\n\nTherefore, $x = 3$.

The word \"triangle\" sells for $6, \"square\" sells for $9, \"pentagon\" sells for $7, \"cube\" sells for $7 and \"tetrahedron\" sells for $8. What is the dollar cost of the word \"octahedron\"? (Source: MATHCOUNTS)\n\nSolution for Problem 5.18: We start by turning the words into equations. We let $a$, $e$, $i$, $o$, and $u$ stand for the price of a, e, i, o, and u, respectively. The information in the problem gives us five equations:\n\n$a + e + i = 6$,\n\n$a + e + u = 9$,\n\n$a + e + o = 7$,\n\n$e + u = 7$,\n\n$a + 2e + o = 8$.\n\nNotice that we put the variables in alphabetical order so we can compare the equations more easily. We almost always do this with linear equations that have multiple variables.\n\nFive variables are a lot to handle. We could solve one equation for one variable and substitute into the others. However, before doing so we look for simpler ways to combine some of the equations to solve for some of the variables. We see that $e + u = 7$ and $a + e + u = 9$, so we must have $a + 7 = 9$. Therefore, we have $a = 2$.\n\nSubstituting $a = 2$ into our equations and simplifying gives\n\n$e + i = 4$,\n\n$e + o = 5$,\n\n$e + u = 7$,\n\n$2e + o = 6$.\n\n(Make sure you see why we don't need to list $e + u = 7$ twice.)\n\nAgain, we could use substitution to reduce the number of variables we are working with, but we can get more information with a quick elimination. Subtracting the second equation from the fourth equation gives $e = 1$. We can then substitute $e = 1$ into each of the first three equations to find $i = 3$, $o = 4$, and $u = 6$. Therefore, our solution is $(a, e, i, o, u) = (2, 1, 3, 4, 6)$.\n\nOur last step is to make sure we answer the question. The dollar cost of \"octahedron\" is $a + e + 2o = $11.
