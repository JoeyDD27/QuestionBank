In this section we consider non-linear equations. In some situations we can still solve the equations simultaneously by substitution. In other situations we can solve the equations simultaneously using a computer graphing package. Consider the graphs of a quadratic function and a linear function on the same set of axes. There are three possible scenarios: cutting (2 points of intersection), touching (1 point of intersection), missing (no points of intersection). The coordinates of any points of intersection can be found by solving the two equations simultaneously."
