Since we are told that Sayed owes $3,301.95 after five years, we have the equation ($2,300)(1 + r/100)^5 = $3,301.95. We wish to isolate r. First we divide both sides by $2,300, which gives us (1 + r/100)^5 = 1.436. We then take the fifth root of both sides. This turns the equation into a simple linear equation: 1 + r/100 = 1.075.

      "solution": "Suppose I invest $x. After 10 years, compounded semi-annually at a rate of 10%, the interest will compound 20 times. During each of these compounding periods, my money multiplies by a factor of (1 + 0.1/2). Therefore, after 20 of these compounding periods, I will have (1 + 0.1/2)^20 * ($x). Since I want this to equal $1,000,000, I have the equation (1 + 0.1/2)^20 * ($x) = $1,000,000. Solving for $x, we find $x = $1,000,000 / (1 + 0.1/2)^20 ≈ $376,889.48."

All three of my payments are the same and my loan is completely paid off after the third payment.",

Suppose I pay $x of this amount at the end of the first year. This leaves me owing $10,600 - $x. During the second year, I am charged (0.06)($10,600 - $x) interest on this amount. This is added to the amount I owe to give $10,600 - $x + (0.06)($10,600 - $x) = 1.06($10,600 - $x). During the third year I am charged 6% interest on this amount, for a total of (1.06)[1.06($10,600 - $x) - $x] = (1.06)[1.06($10,600) - $x) - $x] = (1.06)^2($10,600) - (1.06)($x) - $x. At the end of the third year, I make my final payment of $x. This amount must equal the total amount I owe, so we have the equation $x = (1.06)($x) + (1.06)^2($10,600 - $x) - (1.06)($x) - $x. This is just a linear equation! With a little work, we find that each of my payments is $3,741.10.",

Suppose the first loan was a one-year loan for $a, the second a two-year loan for $b, and the third a three-year loan for $c. All three loans are at 6% compounded annually, and I pay off each loan at the end of its term with a payment of $x. Since all three payments I make are $x, we have $x = (1.06)($a), $x = (1.06)^2($b), and $x = (1.06)^3($c). Substituting these into $a + $b + $c = $10,000 gives $x/1.06 + $x/1.06^2 + $x/1.06^3 = $10,000. Solving this equation tells us that each of my payments must be $x = $3,741.10.",
        "method_3": "Use present value. Those three expressions in our final linear equation in Solution 2 look like present values. In fact, $x/1.06 is the present value of the payment of $x that I make at the end of the first year. Similarly, the present value of the $x payment after the second year is $x/1.06^2, and the present value of the $x payment after the third year is $x/1.06^3. The sum of these three present values gives the total value today of the three payments I make in the future. This total value today of my future payments must exactly equal the $10,000 I borrow today. Therefore, we have the equation $x/1.06 + $x/1.06^2 + $x/1.06^3 = $10,000. We've already solved it in Solution 2 to find $x ≈ $3,741.10 as the payment I must make at the end of each year."

In order to isolate n, we raise both sides to the -2/3 power, since (n^(-3/2))^(-2/3) = n^((-3/2)(-2/3)) = n^1 = n: (n^(-3/2))^(-2/3) = 3^(-2/3). This gives us n = 1/3^(2/3) = 1/(cube root of 3)^2 = (cube root of 3)/(cube root of 3) * (cube root of 3)/(cube root of 3)^3 = (cube root of 3)/3."
