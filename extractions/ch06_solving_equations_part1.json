Solving that second equation for $z$ looks scary, though. Moreover, if $z$ is itself a nasty expression, it may not be easy to evaluate.\n\nConcept: Focusing on what makes a problem tricky helps identify what strategies might best solve the problem.\n\nWe know that squaring gets rid of square roots, but squaring either of our equations alone won't look too helpful. However, we notice that the right sides of our equations are of the form $a - b$ and $a + b$, where $a = z$ and $b = \\sqrt{z^2 - 5}$. So if we multiply the two equations, we can use difference of squares:\n$$5xy = (z - \\sqrt{z^2 - 5})(z + \\sqrt{z^2 - 5}) = z^2 - (z^2 - 5) = 5.$$\nThe right side is the factorization of a difference of squares, so we have $5xy = 5$, so $xy = 1$.\n\nTherefore, $xy = 1$.
