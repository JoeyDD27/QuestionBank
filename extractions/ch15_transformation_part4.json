The number was then published with this notation in 1736.\n\nIn 1748, Euler evaluated $e$ correct to 18 decimal places.\n\nEuler also discovered some patterns in continued fraction expansions of $e$. He wrote that\n\n$\\frac{e-1}{2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{6 + \\frac{1}{10 + \\frac{1}{14 + \\frac{1}{18 + ...}}}}}$ and $e - 1 = 1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{2 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{4 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1 + ...}}}}}}}$\n\nOne may think that $e$ was chosen because it was the first letter of Euler's name or for the word exponential, but it is likely that it was just the next vowel available since he had already used $a$ in his work.",
