This leaves me owing\n\n$\\$10,600 - \\$x$.\n\nDuring the second year, I am charged $(0.06)(\\$10,600 - \\$x)$ interest on this amount. This is added to the amount I owe to give\n\n$\\$10,600 - \\$x + (0.06)(\\$10,600 - \\$x) = 1.06(\\$10,600 - \\$x)$.\n\nThen, I make another payment of $\\$x$, leaving me owing\n\n$1.06(\\$10,600 - \\$x) - \\$x$.\n\nDuring the third year I am charged 6% interest on this amount, for a total of\n\n$(0.06)[1.06(\\$10,600 - \\$x) - \\$x]$\n\nin interest. Adding this to the amount I owed at the end of the second year gives me a total amount owed at the end of the third year of\n\n$1.06(\\$10,600 - \\$x) - \\$x + (0.06)[1.06(\\$10,600 - \\$x) - \\$x] = (1.06)[1.06(\\$10,600 - \\$x) - \\$x]$.\n\nAt the end of the third year, I make my final payment of $\\$x$. This amount must equal the total amount I owe, so we have the equation\n\n$\\$x = (1.06)[1.06(\\$10,600 - \\$x) - \\$x]$.\n\nThis is just a linear equation! We know how to solve linear equations. With a little work, we find that $x$ is approximately 3,741.1, so each of my payments is $\\$3,741.10$.\n\nSolution 2: Break the loan into three loans. We think of my three payments as paying off three separate loans that initially totaled $\\$10,000$. Suppose the first loan was a one-year loan for $\\$a$, the second a two-year loan for $\\$b$, and the third a three-year loan for $\\$c$. All three are 6% loans compounded annually, and I pay off each loan at the end of its term with a payment of $\\$x$.\n\nSince the three loans together must total the $\\$10,000$ I need to borrow, we have\n\n$\\$a + \\$b + \\$c = \\$10,000$.\n\nSince all three payments I make are $\\$x$, we have:\n\n$\\$x = (1.06)(\\$a)$\n$\\$x = (1.06)^2(\\$b)$\n$\\$x = (1.06)^3(\\$c)$\n\nWe solve these three equations for $\\$a$, $\\$b$, and $\\$c$ to find\n\n$\\$a = \\frac{\\$x}{1.06}$, $\\$b = \\frac{\\$x}{1.06^2}$, $\\$c = \\frac{\\$x}{1.06^3}$.\n\nSubstituting these into $\\$a + \\$b + \\$c = \\$10,000$ gives\n\n$\\frac{\\$x}{1.06} + \\frac{\\$x}{1.06^2} + \\frac{\\$x}{1.06^3} = \\$10,000$.\n\nOnce again, we have a linear equation. Solving this equation tells me that each of my payments must be $\\$x \\approx \\$3,741.10$.\n\nSolution 3: Use present value. Those three expressions in our final linear equation in Solution 2 look like present values. In fact,\n\n$\\frac{\\$x}{1.06}$\n\nis the present value of the payment of $\\$x$ that I make at the end of the first year.\n\nSimilarly, the present value of the $\\$x$ payment after the second year is\n\n$\\frac{\\$x}{1.06^2}$,\n\nand the present value of the $\\$x$ payment after the third year is\n\n$\\frac{\\$x}{1.06^3}$.\n\nThe sum of these three present values gives the total value today of the three payments I make in the future. This total value today of my future payments must exactly equal the $\\$10,000$ I borrow today. Therefore, we have the equation\n\n$\\frac{\\$x}{1.06} + \\frac{\\$x}{1.06^2} + \\frac{\\$x}{1.06^3} = \\$10,000$.\n\nThis equation looks familiar! We've already solved it in Solution 2 to find\n\n$\\$x \\approx \\$3,741.10$\n\nas the payment I must make at the end of each year.",
