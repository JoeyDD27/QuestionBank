Our system of equations then is\n\n$y = \\frac{3}{5}x + \\frac{1}{5}$,\n$y = \\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{4}{5}$.\n\nWe see that the two lines have the same slope, $3/5$.\n\n(b) The two lines appear to never intersect. We can try to find their intersection point algebraically by subtracting the second equation in part (a) from the first. This gives us $0 = 1$. This equation is never true, so there is no solution to this system of equations. In other words, there is no point at which the two lines meet. So, the lines are parallel.\n\n(c) Inspired by this example, we wonder if any two lines with the same slope must be parallel. We can analyze two non-vertical lines with the same slope by using slope-intercept form. This form allows us to use the information that the slopes of the lines are equal. Let the common slope of the two lines be $m$ and let their $y$-intercepts be $(0, b_1)$ and $(0, b_2)$, respectively. Therefore, our lines are the graphs of the equations\n\n$y = mx + b_1$,\n$y = mx + b_2$.\n\nWe eliminate both $x$ and $y$ from this system of equations when we subtract the second equation from the first. This leaves $0 = b_1 - b_2$. We then have two cases:\n\n- Case 1: $b_1 \\neq b_2$. If $b_1 \\neq b_2$, then the equation $0 = b_1 - b_2$ has no solutions. This means there is no ordered pair $(x, y)$ that satisfies both $y = mx + b_1$ and $y = mx + b_2$. So, there is no point $(x, y)$ that is on the graphs of both equations. Therefore, the graphs of these equations are lines that never meet, which means the lines are parallel.\n\n- Case 2: $b_1 = b_2$. This makes the equations $y = mx + b_1$ and $y = mx + b_2$ the same. As we saw in Problem 8.24, this means that the graphs of these equations are the same line.\n\nThat two lines with the same slope are either parallel or the same line shouldn't be surprising.

      "content_latex": "Problem 8.26: On the same Cartesian plane, graph both the equations in the system of equations\n\n$x = -2y + 10$,\n$2x - y = 5$.\n\n(a) What is the slope of each line?\n\n(b) How are the two lines related?\n\n(c) Can you come up with a general rule that this problem represents?\n\nSolution for Problem 8.26: The graphs of the lines are shown below.\n\n[Graph showing two perpendicular lines: $x = -2y + 10$ and $2x - y = 5$]\n\n(a) Writing $x = -2y + 10$ in slope-intercept form gives $y = -x/2 + 5$. So, the graph of this equation is a line with slope $-1/2$. The slope of the graph of $2x - y = 5$ is $-2/(-1) = 2$.\n\n(b) The two lines appear to be perpendicular.\n\n(c) We examine these two lines to see if, and why, they are perpendicular. Perhaps the answer will lead to a general rule. The angle between the two lines is determined by the orientation of the lines; so, this angle is determined by the slopes of the lines.\n\nWe take a close-up look at where the lines meet to investigate the angle between them. In the diagram at right, our lines meet at point $X$. The line $2x - y = 5$ has slope 2, so to get from $X$ to another point on this line, we go down 2 to $C$ then left 1 to $D$. Similarly, the line $x = -2y + 10$ has slope $-1/2$, so we get from $X$ to another point on this line by going left 2 to $A$ and up 1 to $B$. Since we build both triangles $XAB$ and $XCD$ by going in one direction 2 units, turning 90 degrees, then going 1 more unit, we see that triangles $XAB$ and $XCD$ are essentially the same. Geometrically speaking, we say they are congruent, which means their sides and angles are the same.\n\nBecause $XAB$ and $XCD$ are congruent, the angle between $\\overline{XB}$ and $\\overline{XA}$ is the same as that between $\\overline{XD}$ and $\\overline{XC}$. In the diagram, we mark both these angles with $\\alpha$. We also mark the angle between $\\overline{XA}$ and $\\overline{XD}$ with $\\beta$. Clearly, the angle between $\\overline{XA}$ and $\\overline{XC}$ is a $90°$ angle, since this angle is made by a horizontal line and vertical line. Therefore, we know that $\\alpha + \\beta = 90°$. But our diagram shows that the angle between our two graphed lines is also $\\alpha + \\beta$! So, we know that the angle between our two graphed lines is $90°$, which means the lines are perpendicular. Similarly, we can show that if any two lines have slopes whose product is $-1$, then the two lines are perpendicular.",
