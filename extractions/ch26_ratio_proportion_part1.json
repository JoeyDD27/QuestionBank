It is used to warn drivers that the road has a steep slope or a steep gradient.\n\nConsider yourself walking up the two hills pictured below.\n\nYou can quite easily see that hill B is steeper than hill A, but in addition to comparing gradient or slope, we often need to measure it.\n\nOne way to measure the gradient is to use ratios.\n\nPicture yourself walking up the sloping side of a right angled triangle. Each step you take, you are moving horizontally to the right, and also vertically upwards.\n\nWe can measure the gradient by using these vertical and horizontal distances. They are the height and base of the triangle. We sometimes call the vertical distance the rise and the horizontal distance the run.\n\nFor example, a gradient of 1 in 4 means we move up 1 unit for every 4 units we move across.\n\nSo, the line segment [AB] shown has gradient 1 in 4 or $1 : 4$.\n\nGradient is the rise : run ratio.",
